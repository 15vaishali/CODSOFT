In this task, I built an ATM Interface using Java. The project showcases my skills in object-oriented programming and user interaction. Here's an overview of my implementation:

The code consists of two main classes: BankAccount and ATM.
The BankAccount class encapsulates the account balance and provides methods to deposit and withdraw funds.
The ATM class handles the user interface and interactions.
When running the program, it displays the ATM options: Withdraw, Deposit, Check Balance, and Exit.
Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding operation, such as withdrawing or depositing funds, checking the account balance, or exiting the ATM.
The code includes input validation to ensure the user enters valid amounts and handles scenarios where the balance is insufficient for a withdrawal.
